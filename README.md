# strike-control
A strategy game developed on a 3-month long school project course. 

The team consisted of four programmers (one of which didn't want his name in the credits) and two 3D artists.  

I was mainly responsible for all of the UI and in-game button functionalities while assisting with other things like turrets. 

I was also in the producer role on this project so I took part in designing and scheduling what to do next. 

We used Unity Collab for version control but I added the project to git for demo purposes.
